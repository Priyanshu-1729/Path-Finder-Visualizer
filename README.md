# Path Finder Visualizer App

![Path Finder Visualizer](path_finder_visualizer.png)

This is a web development project focused on visualizing various pathfinding algorithms. The application allows users to interactively visualize and understand the process of finding optimal paths from a start point to an end point.

## Features

- Implemented DFS (Depth-First Search), BFS (Breadth-First Search), Dijkstra's, and A* algorithms to determine the optimal path between the start and end points.
- Ensured accurate pathfinding results with minimal complexity by leveraging well-known pathfinding algorithms.
- Utilized ReactDOM to render the web page dynamically, enabling users to select start and end points, add walls, and choose different traversal algorithms.
- Enhanced user experience by incorporating CSS Bootstrap Framework, which provided an appealing visual presentation and animated traversal paths from the start point to the endpoint.

## Demo

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/path-finder-visualizer.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd path-finder-visualizer`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- Select a start point and an end point on the grid.
- Add walls by clicking on the cells to block certain paths.
- Choose a traversal algorithm from the available options (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, A*).
- Visualize the pathfinding algorithm in action as it finds the optimal path from the start to the end point.

## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- React.js
- ReactDOM
- CSS Bootstrap Framework

## Future Enhancements

- Implement additional pathfinding algorithms, such as Bidirectional Search and Jump Point Search, to provide more options for path visualization.
- Add additional customization features, such as adjusting the speed of the visualization and changing the grid size.
- Include a feature to export or save the generated path for later reference.
